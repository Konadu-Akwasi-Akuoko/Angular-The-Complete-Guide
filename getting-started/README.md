## What is Angular?

Angular is a javascript framework that allows you to create **reactive** single page applications. Reactive in this sense means Angular applications can continue to run even when waiting for a data fetching or any other asynchronous thing to be done, rather than blocking the whole application from running, thus the web app is designed to react to changes in the data flow and events rather than blocking and waiting for these events.

## Angular vs Angular 2 vs Latest Angular

The first version of Angular was Angular 1 or AngularJS, and the next version of Angular came out in 2016 which was Angular 2. Angular 2 was a completely rewritten version of Angular compared to Angular 1 or AngularJS. Now the latest version of Angular is Angular 17 (as of writing) which was built on top of Angular 2, 3, 4, ..., and so on, ever since it was released in 2016. But you can just call it Angular.
